 well-known story from the Yoga Vashishtha is the one about King Janaka's brother-in-law, the demon king Sambara. When Sambara's city of gold and precious stones is attacked by the gods, he creates three demon-like projections of himself to fight. These projections are so powerful and effective that the gods are defeated, and they flee to Brahma for help. Instead of giving direct help, Brahma advises them on the merits of Sambara's creation, stating that his projections are like robots with no feelings, and that the gods should abandon comparison and competition.
